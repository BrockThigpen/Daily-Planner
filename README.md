# Daily-Planner

Made with HTML and CSS powered by JQuery

The application has the current day and month displayed at the top of the page, as well as time slots for each hour of a typical work day that you can fill in with tasks. Each slot has a save button that will save any information entered into said slot in order to keep the application current when closing and reopening. The time slots are also color coded to help keep track of your progress throughout the day. Gray is for time slots that have already passed, red is for the current time slot, and green is for upcoming time slots. 

This application was created as a home work assignment for the UNCC full stack flex bootcamp. While creating this application I was able to implement a lot of the JQuery fundamentals taught in the course, as well as gain a substanial amount of practice.
